## Here we will write some basic rules & standards.

We:
- keep our code clean and readable,
- we say NO to spaghetti,
- our standard is PEP 8,
- we DRY,
- we write docstrings and comments,

**Parsers**

For parsing web pages is better to use `lxml` library instead of `Beautiful Soup`.

**List/dicts comprehensions**

Try avoid using `i for i in list`, better `link for link in links` where you can understand each element easily.
